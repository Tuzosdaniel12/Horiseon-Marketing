# Horiseon-Marketing

For this project I took Horiseon website and input **accessibility** standard.
I first add a descriptive title to the website, that people will know what type of website they are visiting.

For the Html document I changed various div tag to more current elements that more descriptive and are easier to fallow as the page goes down; such as Header. Navigation, main section, aside section, footer. in the code you will notice that also add comments to all the action I took as I was changing some of tag elements. I added alt attributes to all images to help does who can't see so they have a the image in there head. change various class to id since most attributes were only been use once. left classes that where used in multiple locations.

For the css document, I follow ths html document and arrange it as the html goes does so does the css. many of the existing div classes were remove, I change div to systematic elements. Similar to html file I added comments to every action I did to have a easy to read css file.
